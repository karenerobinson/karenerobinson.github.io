  description: 'James was an undergraduate at McGill University, where he worked in the lab of [Francois Fagotto](http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/fagotto/) on [Xenopus developmental biology](/publications#20974811).
    During the summers, he returned to his hometown of Toronto and worked in [Alan Davidson''s lab](http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidsonlab/Davidson_Lab/Home.html) on TetR repressor biophysics and [bacteriophage genomics](/publications#16631788).


    He moved to California in 2005 to do his PhD in [Molecular and Cellular Biology at UC Berkeley](http://mcb.berkeley.edu).
    There, he worked with [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/) creating  biophysical methods to characterize [protein side chain flexibility](/publications#20499387) in [high resolution](/publications#17573816) X-ray [electron density maps](/publications#24363322).
    They applied these techniques to study connections between [conformational dynamics and enzymatic catalysis](/publications#19956261), showing that [room temperature](/publications#21918110), but not standard cryogenic, X-ray data collection could reveal the structural basis for critical functional motions.


    Near the end of his PhD, he was an [EMBO Short-Term Fellow](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/short-term-fellowships) in [Dan Tawfik''s lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biological_Chemistry/scientist/Tawfik/).
    Concurrently, he authored the problems and solutions manual for the physical chemistry textbook [The Molecules of Life](http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815341888) by Kuriyan, Konforti, and Wemmer.


    In January 2011, James started his [independent career](http://fellows.ucsf.edu/) as a [QB3 at UCSF Fellow](http://qb3.ucsf.edu/events/mini-bio-james-fraser.shtml) affiliated with the [Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology](http://cmp.ucsf.edu/).
    In January 2013, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences](http://bts.ucsf.edu) and the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences ([QB3](http://qb3.org)) with promotion to Associate Professor in 2016.
    The lab is also part of the [Macromolecular Structure Group at UCSF](http://msg.ucsf.edu) and [BioXFEL](https://www.bioxfel.org/), a Science and Technology Center established by the National Science Foundation.
    We maintain a deep connection with [Beamline 8.3.1.](http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~mcfuser/), directed by [James Holton](http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~jamesh/), at the [Advanced Light Source](http://www-als.lbl.gov/). James is also a Consulting Professor in Photon Science at the Stanford SLAC National Laboratory.


    James is a recipient of the [NIH Early Independence Award](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2011/09/10713/protein-scientist-receives-national-institutes-health-early-investigator-award), [a Pew Scholar Award](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-biomedical-scholars/directory-of-pew-scholars/2014/james-s-fraser), [a Searle Scholar Award](http://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/news/2014/04/09/1/), and [a Packard Fellowship](http://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/conservation-and-science/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/fellowship-directory/fraser-james/).
    In addition to all the exciting developments in the lab, James has a long standing interest in teaching computational biology with practical courses (he is the director of the [BBC PUBS class](/pubs) and the student-led programming course he developed with Lenny Teytelman and Venky Iyer [continues to this day](http://intro-prog-bioinfo-2014.wikispaces.com/)) and with [baseball statistics](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/news/california-magazine/mayjune-2007-new-food-and-farming/playing-stats) (as explained in this [awkward video](http://ibiomagazine.org/issues/november-2011-issue/james-fraser-a-michael-eisen.html) with Mike Eisen).

He received his Ph.D. in 2014 from UCLA, where he worked under the direction of Todd Yeates, investigating structure-function relationships in a key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, Michael will examine how amino acid substitutions alter the catalytic rates of enzymes by modifying their conformational ensembles. This work will emphasize the characterization of disease-associated mutations found in human proteases. Additionally, Michael will work on developing experimental methodology for studying conformational heterogeneity and structural dynamics of protein molecules using X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs).
