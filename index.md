# Welcome to the Zunder Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.virginia.edu/) in the [School of Medicine](http://www.med.virginia.edu/) and [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/).

Research in our laboratory is focused on discovering the mechanisms that control stem cell fate. Specifically, we seek to identify factors that control the progression and branch points of cellular differentiation. To accomplish this, we are building experimental and computational tools that track cell populations as they change over time, using molecular characterization at the single-cell level. Our goal is to define the fundamental principles of stem cell differentiation, and apply this knowledge to the development of regenerative transplantation therapies.
